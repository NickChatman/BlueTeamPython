# leap year calculator

#If a year is evenly divisible by 4 means having no remainder then go to next step. If it is not divisible by 4. It is not a leap year. For example: 1997 is not a leap year.
#If a year is divisible by 4, but not by 100. For example: 2012, it is a leap year. If a year is divisible by both 4 and 100, go to next step.
#If a year is divisible by 100, but not by 400. For example: 1900, then it is not a leap year. If a year is divisible by both, then it is a leap year. So 2000 is a leap year.

year = int(input('Enter year : '))

if (year%4 == 0 and year%100 != 0) or (year%400 == 0) :
    print(year, "is a leap year.")
else :
    print(year, "is not a leap year.")
